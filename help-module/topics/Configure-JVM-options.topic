            Autotest is an important part of the development process.
            Developing autotests is no different from developing software.
            Therefore, itâ€™s vital to approach it with the same amount of attention and diligence.

            In the case of manual testing, all verifications are performed by QA engineers who are in charge of product quality. They take on the role of users, simulating situations according to the task requirements and recording the results. Some parts of the functionality might work incorrectly. When a manual tester finds these defects, they create a document describing the problem, or the bug, and pass it on to a software developer. After the bug is fixed, the QA engineer rechecks the functionality.
