<def title="%NUM%. Gutter area">
The left gutter provides additional information about your code and displays the various icons that
identify the code structure, bookmarks, breakpoints, scope indicators,
change markers and the code folding lines that let you hide arbitrary code blocks.
<p>You can change the behavior of the left gutter. </p>
<p>For example, it's possible to make the left gutter thinner
by hiding the gutter icons. This is done either for the <a anchor="active">active editor</a>,
or for all the newly created editors.</p>
<p>To change the behavior of the left gutters, use either the
<a href="Setup.topic">Appearance</a> page of the editor settings, or the
<ui-path>Editor Gutter Popup Menu</ui-path> (use the <a href="Setup.topic">Search Everywhere</a>
action to invoke it):</p>
<p>By default, this command is not mapped to any keyboard shortcut. You can create your own
                            shortcut as described in the section <a href="APIs.md"/>.
                            <!--configuring keyboard shortcuts--> </p>

<p>Clicking a tab while the <shortcut key="ActivateNuGetToolWindow"/> key is
pressed, allows navigating to any part of the file path, through opening it in an external browser.</p>
