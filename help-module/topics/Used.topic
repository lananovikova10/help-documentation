            The following table describes network ports that must be opened to ensure proper communication with Microsoft Windows servers.</p>

        <p>Each Microsoft Windows server that is a backup infrastructure component or a machine for which you enable application-aware processing must have these ports opened. If you want to use the server as a backup infrastructure component, you must also open ports that the component role requires.</p>

        <p>For example, if you assign the role of a backup proxy to your Microsoft Windows server, you must open ports listed below and also ports listed in the Backup Proxy section.</p>

        <p>The Microsoft Windows server that acts as an NFS file share requires network ports listed below and also ports listed in the NFS Backup Repository.
            The Microsoft Windows server that acts as an SMB file share requires network ports listed below and also ports listed in the SMB Backup Repository.</p>
